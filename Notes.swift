 -All icons for category is found in website icon8
 -Using EnvironmentObject to transit the Onboarding process to the Home screen, below is the site of environmentObject:
 https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-use-environmentobject-to-share-data-between-views
 
 -We have some extension on Array to remove dup, and on UIScreen dim to dictate the dim of screen
 -We add some Helpers func (freely access from anywhere)
 
 -If we see func with "async throws", we can make it "async" by include 'do catch' inside the func with some 'try await' phrase. Otherwise, we can still make them "async throws" and no need to include 'do catch' block.
 
 -For scrolling the HScrollV, gotta add tapGesture to make it interactive scrollable (on screen 17, onTapGesture)
